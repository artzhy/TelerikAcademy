## Defensive Programming and Exceptions

For the exercises use the Visual Studio solution "[homework.zip](https://github.com/neutrino-git/TelerikAcademy/raw/master/Programming/04.HighQualityCode/09.Assertions-and-Exceptions/homework.zip)".

1. Add `assertions` in the code from the project **"Assertions-Homework"** to ensure all possible preconditions and postconditions are checked.
* Add `exception handling` (where missing) and refactor all incorrect error handling in the code from the **"Exceptions-Homework"** project to follow the best practices for using exceptions.
