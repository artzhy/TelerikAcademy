## Refactoring

Refactor the C# code from "[Refactoring-Homework.zip](https://github.com/neutrino-git/TelerikAcademy/raw/master/Programming/04.HighQualityCode/13.Refactoring-Homework/Refactoring-Homework.zip)" to improve its internal quality. You might follow the following steps:

1. Make some initial refactorings like:
    * Reformat the code.
    * Rename the ugly named variables.
* Make the code testable.
    * Think how to test console-based input / output.
* Write unit tests. Fix any bugs found in the mean time.
* Refactor the code following the guidelines from this chapter. Do it step by step. Run the unit tests after each major change.
