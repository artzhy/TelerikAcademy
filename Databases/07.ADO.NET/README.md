## Data Access with ADO.NET

1. Write a program that retrieves from the `Northwind` sample database in MS SQL Server the number of  rows in the `Categories` table.
* Write a program that retrieves the name and description of all categories in the `Northwind` DB.
* Write a program that retrieves from the `Northwind` database all product categories and the names of the products in each category. Can you do this with a single SQL query (with table join)?
* Write a method that adds a new product in the products table in the `Northwind` database. Use a parameterized SQL command.
* Write a program that retrieves the images for all categories in the `Northwind` database and stores them as JPG files in the file system.
* Create an Excel file with 2 columns: `name` and `score`:

    | Name            | Score  |
    | --------------- |:------:|
    | Svetlin Nakov   | 25     |
    | Doncho Minkov   | 22     |
    | Nikolay Kostov  | 24     |
    | Georgi Georgiev | 20     |

    Write a program that reads your MS Excel file through the OLE DB data provider and displays the name and score row by row.
* Implement appending new rows to the Excel file.
* Write a program that reads a string from the console and finds all products that contain this string. Ensure you handle correctly characters like `', %, ", \ and _`.
* Download and install `MySQL` database, `MySQL Connector/Net` (.NET Data Provider for MySQL) + `MySQL Workbench` GUI administration tool . Create a MySQL database to store `Books` (title, author, publish date and ISBN). Write methods for listing all books, finding a book by name and adding a book.
* Re-implement the previous task with SQLite embedded DB (see http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com).
